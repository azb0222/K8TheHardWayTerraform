TODO: 
- create deployment script 
  (ie. run terraform apply, run terraform output, grab ip, etc. )

- need to setup a bucket to store terraform state file 

- use workspaces for testing something before applying it in the final prod code
- use templatefile(<PATH>, <VARS>) for all the installation you have to do for each server 
- look at how to manage secrets in the book, and change to have your credentails.json file do that 
- use provisioners to setup ansible 
- have two branches, one using ansible for those who want to keep learning https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ansible-with-terraform-for-configuration-management


- make some sort of way to manage global variables so that i do not have to pass in the same project name variable to every single module
