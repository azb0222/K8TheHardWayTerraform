TODO: 
- create deployment script 
  (ie. run terraform apply, run terraform output, grab ip, etc. )

- need to setup a bucket to store terraform state file 

- use workspaces for testing something before applying it in the final prod code
- use templatefile(<PATH>, <VARS>) for all the installation you have to do for each server 
- look at how to manage secrets in the book, and change to have your credentails.json file do that 
- use provisioners to setup ansible
